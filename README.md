# Date-Converter-AD-BS

## English Calendar (AD/Gregorian Calendar/Solar Calendar) 
English Calendar (AD) is based on the solar cycle and the easy part of it is that the days in the months of AD are same every year except for February.
In leap years, february has 29 days instead of 28.

## Nepali Calendar (Bikram Shambat Calendar/Lunar Calendar)
In the Lunar calendar (BS), the days in the months vary from year to year. They work on the concept of 'tithi' which I didn't understand at all.
What I did is, collect the data of number of days in each month from year 2075 BS to year 2090 BS. Also stored equivalent english day of the
2075/1/1. Then when converting from AD to BS, I counted each day from 2075 BS according to the days in the months to get the precise BS.
